### JPEG200_open
This ia a simple jpeg2000 hardware encoder.
#### feature supported

*    Monochrome 
*    Wavelet transforms: 5/3Â 
*    Decomposition levels:  1~5
*    Layer: Only one layer
*    Tile:  128x128
*    Code Block: 64x64

#### Description
It only supports dwt53 and  does not have ratecontrol , actually it is a lossless encoder. 
For simplicity it uses Tile 128x128 and CodeBlock 64x64,  so there is only one codeblcok in a Band, 
and does not need external DDR memory to store intermediate coeff and stream. 

This code is just for function evaluation, no optimization techniques for speed and area applied.
